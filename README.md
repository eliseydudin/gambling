# lets-go-gambling
a telegram bot for gambling :fire:

# setup
basically all you need to do is to redact the `.env` file, and put your telegram bot's token in there.
example:
```.env
TOKEN = "ABCDEFG:123456"
```
after that just do `uv run gambling/__init__.py`.
the bot will create a `gambling.db` file, in which you can work with users' data.
